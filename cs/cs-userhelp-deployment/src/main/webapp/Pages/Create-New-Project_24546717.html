                    <p>The main characteristic of a new project is the <strong>Project Type</strong>. Project types are predefined into the system and aim to allow different users to be able to use data and features specific to their environment, department, job.</p><p>For a <strong>Project Type</strong> could be specified:<br /> <strong>1. Specific project details</strong> - these are the details that we need to keep into the project profile, and which characterize it better. For example for some project types we may need to keep budget information, for others we may want to keep project objectives, for third - information about partner institutions, etc. Also we may want project IDs for different types to follow different templates (some to start with PRJ+counter, others to start with DEV+counter+date, etc. ) Project types allow users to be flexible and not to stick to one set of data.<br /> <strong>2. Specific types of sub-projects/ cases per project</strong> - a project type may require that only certain types of activities could be performed, so an user when creating new sub-projects/ cases will be able to select them from a restricted list.<br /> <strong>3. Specific workflows</strong> for a project type.  A list with available workflows is set up. For example one project type may require a workflow for review and approval before being started, other may require a specific workflow for final completion, etc.</p><p>The project of type <strong>&quot;Generic&quot;</strong> allows users to create projects with no restrictions on workflows and sub-projects.</p><ul><li>The user is able to create a new project from:<ul><li>Personal dashboard/ main menu Projects/ New Project <strong>(1-2) or<br /></strong></li><li>Personal dashboard/ &quot;My projects&quot; dashlet,/ New Project <strong>(3-4)</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546717/24707675.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546717/24707675.png"></img></p><ul><li>The system opens the screen where the user selects the project type from a drop down menu <strong>(1-2)</strong>.</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546717/24707677.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546717/24707677.png"></img></p><ul><li>The system opens the screen for the entering the project details.

The user could change the visibility to &quot;Visible for project members only&quot;.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ul><li style="list-style-type: none;background-image: none;"><ul><li>The user selects the button <strong>&quot;Save&quot;(7)</strong>.</li></ul></li></ul><p>The button &quot;Save&quot; in new project details screen is active, only when the mandatory fields for saving a project are filled.</p><p>The button <strong>&quot;Cancel&quot;</strong> (next to button &quot;Save&quot;) is active at any time, and the user could cancel new project creation at any time. If &quot;Cancel&quot; is selected after updates are made, the user is warned that changes will be lost and will be given a chance to abort the cancel operation.</p><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546717/24707679.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546717/24707679.png"></img></p><ul><li>The user is transferred automatically to the <strong>&quot;Project profile&quot;</strong> view of the newly created project. <br /><ul><li>When new project is created and its details are saved for the first time the following project metadata are generated automatically:<ul><li><strong>Status (1)</strong><strong>- </strong>the project status of a newly created project is automatically<strong> set to &quot;Submitted&quot;</strong></li><li><strong>Unique Identifier(ID) (2)</strong> - the unique project identifier is given automatically to the project.
