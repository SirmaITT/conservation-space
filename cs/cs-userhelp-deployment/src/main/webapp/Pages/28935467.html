                    <p>In this section the requirements for managing the content of an intelligent document (iDoc) are described.</p><p>The iDoc is treated in the system as a primary object of type &quot;Document&quot;. The difference is that the iDoc is with a HTML content.</p><p>The iDoc inherits all actions on a Document in the system - Clone, Move, Delete, Edit Properties, Version tracking, Revert to previous version, etc.</p><p>Here are described only the actions specific to the iDoc content - creating new iDoc, spell check and grammar check of the content, export in different formats, editing the content.</p><p>Each<strong> iDoc has three vertical sections</strong>: Document tree view, Document content and Comments section.</p><ol><li><strong>Tree view section</strong> - shows the hierarchical structure of a document.</li><li><strong>Content section</strong> - shows all the widgets used in the document plus the HTML content (for more details see below).</li><li><strong>Comments section</strong>Â  - shows all comments on the document. Each document section could be commented.</li></ol><p>For iDoc we introduce the term <strong>Widget</strong>. The Widget is a pluggable and customizable application fragment representing an object or a piece of object. <span lang="en"><span class="hps">It</span> <span class="hps">could represent a</span> <span class="hps">whole range</span> <span class="hps">of</span> <span class="hps">things</span> <span class="hps">from simple</span> <span class="hps">rich</span> <span class="hps">text block</span> <span class="hps">to complex</span> <span class="hps">semantic</span> <span class="hps">queries.</span></span><br /> In the<strong> iDoc content section</strong> the following types of widgets are used: <strong>default widgets</strong> (which the user is not able to alter) and <strong>selectable widgets</strong> which the user may select during the creation/ editing of the document. The widgets are used to create the document content and format it in a way that fits best to the user's needs.</p><p>When a new document is created based on a template, then all predefined widgets in the template are mandatory.</p><p>When a new document is created from scratch then:</p><p>1. The Content section consists of the following <strong>default widgets</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Document Identification</strong> - shows the Document ID, Document Title, Bread Crumb navigation</li><li><strong>Document actions</strong> - this widget presents a list of all actions <strong>on the document content</strong> - Save, Preview, etc. These actions are <strong>different from the actions on the object Document</strong> - Delete, Clone etc.</li><li><strong>Text Editor</strong> - this is a built in text editor that allows the user to perform basic text formatting actions - headings, font changes, color text, bold text, etc, the use would also be able to insert/ delete/ edit simple tables, insert links to other objects.</li><li><strong>Documents metadata</strong> - displays the document metadata</li></ul><p>2. The user could <strong>select </strong>from the following<strong> widgets</strong> to insert in a document. One and the same widget could be inserted more than once.</p><ul><li><strong>Main Object Selection</strong> - a widget in which the user is able to select a first class system object and then choose which metadata of the object to be visible in the document. (TBD: How would be decided/selected automatically the object instance to be displayed, a parameter is needed.)</li><li><strong>Add entity</strong> - the user is able to select an instance to be displayed.</li><li><strong>Add facts</strong> - the user is able to add new facts on the selected instance.</li><li><strong>Actions</strong> - for the selected instance, based on the object type the user would be able to perform basic actions.</li><li><strong>Table of Content</strong> - the widget will automatically create document table of content based on the existing headings.</li><li><strong>iDoc Data Table</strong> - the widget is described in a separated section &quot;iDoc Data Tables&quot;.</li><li>Others</li></ul>
