                    <p>The system provides <strong>&quot;entity recognition&quot; functionality in uploaded and created documents</strong>, recognizing object <strong>by combination of some of its properties</strong>. Each property is non-unique, but becomes unique when combined with another property.</p><p>The user<strong> is able to specify</strong> (in the definition):</p><ol><li>The objects that should be recognized in the documents and/or the objects.</li><li>The documents that should be recognized in the documents and/or the objects.</li><li>The combination of properties for each object or document that should be searched.</li><li>Where in the documents the system should search for the respective objects (title, description, content, etc.)</li></ol><p><strong>Example 1:</strong> This functionality  is needed because in a document there could be the name of a user &lt;FirstName&gt;&lt;space&gt;&lt;FamilyName&gt;, and neither the First Name is unique property, nor the Family Name, but the combination of the 2 names is unique (we don't have in the document the userID, which is unique). So the user is identified by the string which is a combination of the two name properties and a space symbol in between and the document and the user are linked.</p><p><strong>Example 2:</strong> The part number and part revision of objects. There are many objects which have one and the same part number, but only the combination of part number and part revision makes the object unique. So when we see the string 123456D we know that this is the part with part number 123456 and the revision of the part is D. The same should do the entity recognition functionality - when the string 123456D is met in a document, the system should uniquely identify  part number 123456, revision D and should link the document with that specific part revision.</p><p><strong>Rules:</strong></p><ol><li>The user is able to set up the system (in the definitions) and <strong>define the combination of properties</strong> that should serve for unique identification of an object in a document</li><li>The user is able to set up the <strong>sequence of the properties in a string and the separator between</strong> the properties: &lt;prop1&gt;&lt;prop2&gt;, or &lt;prop1&gt; &lt;prop2&gt;, or &lt;prop1&gt;/&lt;prop2&gt;_&lt;prop3&gt;, etc.</li></ol>
