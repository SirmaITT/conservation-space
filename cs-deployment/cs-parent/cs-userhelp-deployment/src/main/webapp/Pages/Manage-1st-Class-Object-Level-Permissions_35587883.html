                    <p><strong>Permissions</strong> in the system are managed<strong> based on roles</strong> that exist. The current hard coded roles in the system are Consumer, Contributor, Collaborator and Manager. There is another role that exists - &quot;Administrator&quot;, but the role of the administrator is given only to some users that will have full permissions on the system and it is not part of the current functionality. <br /> The system will be extended with functionality to allow organizations to create their own specific roles and to define for each role the specific actions that could perform.<br /> Each object in the system could have special permissions that cover the security policy in the organization.<br /> In general, for each user/ group could be given one of the following<strong> roles</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Consumer</strong> – could only view the object (project, case, document, cultural object), cannot edit it, or upload content to it, or edit uploaded content</li><li><strong>Contributor</strong> – could create new objects and edit/ delete only the objects he created</li><li><strong>Collaborato</strong>r – could create new objects and edit objects created by others, but could delete objects created by himself</li><li><strong>Manager</strong> – has full permissions on the object– could edit/ delete objects created by himself and the other users, could manage the permissions on the object</li><li><strong>No permissions</strong> – could not see the object at all, even if make searches in the system</li></ul><p>The following<strong> main principles</strong> of the security policy are followed in the system:</p><ul><li>When a new object is created it will inherit automatically the permissions of its parent. For example:<ul><li>When a case is created it will automatically inherit the permissions given to users on project level (for example: if I am consumer in a project, I will be consumer by default on each of the cases in the project)</li><li>When a document is created in a case - then the document will automatically inherit the permissions given on case level (for example: If I am collaborator in a case, I will remain collaborator for each newly created/uploaded document in the case)</li><li>When a new object is created in a library, it will automatically inherit the permissions given on library level. This means that if I set to the Painting library – that everyone has consumer privileges and only the users from group &quot;Painting department&quot; have Collaborator privileges, then every object of type Painting that is created into the system will inherit the same permissions.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>When the permissions on parent object are changed, then automatically the new permissions will be inherited from its children object. For example:<ul><li>When I want to restrict permissions on a case, and set for all users except me that they will have &quot;No permissions&quot; on the case, then all documents in the case automatically inherit the case permissions and also become invisible for the users. I am the only one that could see the case and documents in it.</li><li>When I change the permissions on a library and add permissions to a newly joined employee, then all objects in the library will inherit the permissions.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>For each single object in the system could have special permissions, independent from its parent permissions. For example:<ul><li>There is a document in a case with some sensitive information and I want it to be visible from only 3 of the members in the project, I could change the permissions of the document and say that the 3 selected users are consumers on the document (could only read it) and all other users have no permissions (it is invisible for them).</li><li>There is a painting in the museum, which no one except few people should know it is there – then I will be able to set special permissions to this painting – and only the few people could see information for it.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>When an object is attached to projects/ cases it keeps its permissions and does not inherit the permissions of the project/ case to which it is attached. For example:<ul><li>Important Internal policy (this is a document) has permissions which say that all users are consumers except me. The document is attached to another project and the document remains with the same permissions.</li><li>A painting has the following permissions: Painting department: Collaborators, all other users: Consumers. When I attach the painting to a case – then it keeps its permissions and does not inherit the permissions from the case it is attached to.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Each object in the system (except projects) will have a property called &quot;<strong>Permissions flag</strong>&quot;. The flag manages the inheritance of parent permissions. The property could have one of the following values:<ul><li><strong>Inherited permissions</strong> – means that the object has no special permissions and inherits the permissions of its parent (for domain objects this would mean that inherits the library permissions) when changed. Every newly created object will be by default with permissions flag &quot;Inherited permissions&quot;</li><li><strong>Inherited and Special permissions</strong> – means that the object will inherit its parent permissions, when changed, but also has special permissions. The flag is used when in addition to the inherited parent permissions are given special permissions to some users. If a user is both in the list with inherited permissions and in the list with special permissions then the special permissions are stronger.</li><li><strong>Special permissions</strong> – means that the object is with deactivated inherited permissions and only has its special permissions (different from the parent permissions). The objects with such flag never inherit the permissions of the parent when they are changed.</li></ul></li></ul>
