This means that the system automatically identifies some existing objects when mentioned/ referred somewhere in the document and <strong>creates relationship</strong> between the respective object and the document. The user is able to specify from one side the objects that should be recognized in the documents by their specific unique properties and from the other side to specify where in the documents the system to search for the respective objects (title, description, content, etc.)</p><p>This functionality facilitates the work with the system and the user is not obliged to manually create relationship between a document and existing object referred in it.</p><p>For example: The user wants when uploading a Condition Report and this condition report is for one cultural object with Accession number: 1986.100.201, the cultural object to be automatically recognized and related with the condition report.</p><p><strong>Rules:</strong></p><ol><li>The user is able to set up the system and say which domain and enterprise objects to be recognized in a document.</li><li>For each object the user is able to specify its unique property (identifier) which to be recognized in a document (Selecting the Title of an art object as property for recognition is not good idea, because there could be multiple objects with the same title, and the system will not be able to identify the object uniquely).</li><li>The user is able toÂ set up the type of relationship that is automatically created between the document and the object in it</li><li>The user is able to set up the document properties in which the system to search and try to recognize any of the selected objects. (This could be document content, Title, Description, etc.)</li><li>If the selected object property is found in a document (or its properties) then automatically a relationship of the respective type between the document and the object is created.</li><li>The entity recognition functionality is working both for uploaded and created documents.</li><li>For uploaded documents the recognition happens after the upload.</li><li>For created documents the recognition happens after the first save of the document.</li><li>If an object is recognized more than once in a document, then only one relationship of the type is created between it and the document.</li><li>If more than one objects are recognized in a document, then a relationship is created between the document and every one of the recognized objects.</li></ol><h3 id="EntityRecognitioninaDocument-Entityrecognitioninadocumentandinsertaspropertyofthedocument">Entity recognition in a document and insert as property of the document</h3><p>The system provides the functionality for &quot;entity recognition&quot; in<strong> uploaded or created</strong> documents and fills in some properties of the document with the recognized data.
