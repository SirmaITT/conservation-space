                    <p>The PM or the team leads are able to create task instances based on the task details from the project timeline and assign tasks to users.<br /> The project schedule (timeline) by itself is just a plan, a work break down structure of the tasks per project. The assignees don't know about their tasks and don't have assignments for them.<br /> The <strong>&quot;Commit task&quot;</strong> functionality aims each user to receive a direct task, assigned to him/her and the PM to be able to track progress on tasks.<span style="font-size: 10.0pt;font-family: Arial;color: black;"> </span></p><p>For each task in the project schedule in its details is kept information about how and when a task will be started - the field name is &quot;Trigger to start&quot;.

Manual start means that <strong>the user must explicitly select a task and start it.</strong></li><li><strong>Automatically, based on the task links</strong> - this option means that <strong>the task will be started based on its predecessor task.</strong> If the link with the predecessor is <strong>Start to Start</strong> then the task will be started when its predecessor starts. If the link with the predecessor is End to Start, then the task will be started when its predecessor finishes.</li><li><strong>Automatically at start date</strong> - this option means that <strong>the task will be started at the date it is planned for.</strong> It is appropriate for tasks which do not depend on other tasks, or for tasks that do not have predecessors but only successors.</li></ol><p>For a task in status &quot;Submitted&quot; the user could change &quot;Trigger to start&quot; at any time (see Edit task details).<br /> Each task in status &quot;Submitted&quot; could be manually started at any time (if not started), no matter what is the value in the &quot;Trigger start&quot; field.</p><p><strong>Preconditions</strong></p><ol><li><span>Commit tasks <strong>could not be performed on sub-tasks of &quot;Workflow</strong>&quot;.</span><span> </span></li><li>The action &quot;Commit task&quot; could be performed on Tasks in status &quot;Submitted&quot;.</li></ol><ul><li>The user opens the project schedule and selects single or multiple tasks and then button &quot;Commit task(s)&quot; from the opened menu.</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546953/24708012.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546953/24708012.png"></img></p><ul><li>The system opens a confirmation screen <strong>(1)</strong> and the user selects the button <strong>&quot;Yes&quot; (2)</strong>.</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546953/24708013.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546953/24708013.png"></img></p><ul><li>The system creates a task instance with task details from the task in the project schedule: task name, task type, planned start date, planned end date, duration, assignee, etc.<ul><li><span>Unique task <strong>ID (1</strong>) is generated to the newly created task.
