                    <p>Manage project schedule functionality described in this section is  intended to help the project managers and team leads in their day to day  activities in project planning, creation of WBS, assigning resources to  tasks, detecting resources work load and availability on projects, and  tracking project progress and performance.<br />
The main advantage comes from the fact that the project timeline is kept  constantly up to date with the real project work by automatic updates that  happen with each user task completion or creation of a new task in the  project and sub project work spaces.</p>

<p>In the project schedule functionality <strong>each of the following primary system objects is treated and represented as a task</strong>:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Project</strong> - only the task of basic type &quot;Project&quot; could not be  created directly into the project schedule. One project schedule could  have only one <strong>task of type&quot;Project&quot;</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Sub-project/ case</strong> - Sub-projects/ cases could be created both from  the project working area, or from the project schedule, as <strong>tasks of  basic type &quot;Sub-project&quot;</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Workflow</strong> - Workflows could be started and created again both from  the project working area, or from the project schedule, as <strong>tasks of  basic type &quot;Workflow&quot;.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Task</strong> - each task being a summary task, or a leaf task, part of workflow or not, is treated as a <strong>task of basic type &quot;Task&quot;</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Basic task types in the Project Schedule are:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>Project</li>
	<li>Sub-project</li>
	<li>Workflow</li>
	<li>Task</li>
	<li>Milestone - milestones are normal tasks but with no effort (TBD: and assignee)</li>
</ul>


<p>These basic task types actually represents the object instances that  will be created from the project schedule. Because each primary object  itself has its own specific type (like Project type, Workflow type,  Sub-project type, Task type) then based on the primary task type the  user will be able to select the specific type.</p>

<p>For example a task with basic type &quot;Workflow&quot; will have specific types &quot;Review and Approval&quot;, &quot;Test new part&quot;, &quot;Design&quot;, etc.</p>
