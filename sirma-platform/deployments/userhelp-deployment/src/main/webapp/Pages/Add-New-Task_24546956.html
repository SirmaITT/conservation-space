Task name</strong> - a free text short name of a task.<br /><strong>      2. Task status</strong> - Task status by default is set to &quot;Submitted&quot;. The user may set the task status to: <strong>Submitted, Approved, InProcess, OnHold, or Completed</strong>.<br /><strong>      3. Task description</strong> - detailed description of a task.<br /><strong>      4. Basic task type</strong> - The user selects on of the following: <strong>Case, Workflow, Task, Milestone [Default = Task]</strong><br /><strong>      5. Estimated effort</strong> - the user could enter number followed by &quot;h&quot; or &quot;d&quot; depending on if the task duration is hours or days. The default task effort is 1d. The <strong>estimated effort is never calculated automatically</strong> as duration between start and end date, <strong>it is fixed by the user.</strong> [Effort and duration are different entities, a task that takes 2 hours of effort may take 2 days to complete. For example, loading software could require 20 minutes to initiate the process, a couple of 5 minutes checks while it installs, and 30 minutes to validate and configure the system at the end, so total effort is 60 minutes - but in real time the install process could take a full day.]<br /><strong>      6.</strong> The user must enter <strong>two</strong> of the following - the third is calculated by the system:<br /><strong>- Planned Task start date</strong> - The user could change the start date by typing a valid date, or by selecting a date from the project calendar. When selecting from the calendar the default selection should be today.<br /><strong>- Planned Task Duration</strong> - A number optionally followed by &quot;h&quot; or &quot;d&quot; for hours or days, respectively - &quot;d&quot; shall be assumed if no &quot;h&quot; or &quot;d&quot; is specified. The Planned Task Duration may be entered by the user or calculated. When it is calculated, the minimum value is 1d.<br /><strong>- Planned Task end date</strong> - The user could change the end date by typing a valid date, or by selecting a date from the project calendar.</p><p><strong>      7. Specific Type</strong> - This type depends on the basic task type selected. There are different specific types per sub-projects, workflows and tasks. By default a task is created always of  the specific type <strong>&quot;Generic&quot;</strong> (such task type exists for any of the basic task types). The user could select task type from any of the defined specific types for the current project type</p><p><strong>     8. Assignee</strong> - tasks in the project timeline could be assigned not only to project members. The PM could select assignee from the existing project members, or to search amongst all users. If the user, assigned to a task is not a project member, then he is automatically assigned as a resource to the project and becomes a member (he is assigned without a role) <strong>(1-2-3)</strong>. A task assignee could be selected also by <strong>drag and drop an user from the Resource section into the task. </strong></p><p>When the necessary data is entered, the user saves the information, clicking the button <strong>&quot;OK&quot; (4)</strong></p><p><strong><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546956/27624285.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546956/27624285.png"></img><br /></strong></p><ul><li> The user saves the task in the schedule.</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546956/24707997.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546956/24707997.png"></img></p><p>For more details that could be entered on a task see &quot;Edit task details&quot;.</p><ul><li>The user is able to <strong>add</strong> a new task as a <strong>Successor (1-2-3) or Predecessor task</strong>.</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546956/24708003.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546956/24708003.png"></img></p><ul><li>The user enters the necessary data for the new task</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546956/24708004.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546956/24708004.png"></img></p><ul><li>The user saves the new task in the schedule.</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546956/24708005.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546956/24708005.png"></img></p><ul><li>If the user adds in a case a sub task of basic type <strong>&quot;Workflow&quot; (1)</strong>:<ul><li>The user must select the type of workflow from a list with available workflows in the Specific types field <strong>(2-3)</strong>.</li><li>When the<strong> Workflow task</strong> is saved <strong>(4)</strong>, then automatically a summary task of type <strong>&quot;Workflow&quot; (5)</strong> is added in the project schedule and sub-tasks - the tasks of the workflow are added.<ul><li>If the selected task (the one selected before the button &quot;Add new task&quot; was selected) is a holder then the workflow is added right after the selected task, and is indented as a sub-task.</li><li>If the selected task is not a holder then the workflow is added right after it and has the same indention as the selected.</li></ul></li><li>The created from the workflow task holder is with name the name of the workflow and each sub-task is with name the name of the task in the workflow.</li><li>Each task is created in status<strong> &quot;Submitted&quot; (6).</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p><span style="color: rgb(255,0,0);"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546956/31949061.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546956/31949061.png"></img></span></p><p> </p><ul><li>When the case is started from the case dashboard, in the project schedule the case status is changed to &quot;In Progress&quot; <strong>(1)</strong> and in the workflow automatically appear the defined predecessor and successor tasks, based on the workflow business process <strong>(2)</strong>.</li></ul><p><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/24546956/31949064.png" data-image-src="attachments/24546956/31949064.png"></img></p>
